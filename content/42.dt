a:14:{s:11:"description";s:625:"<p>Scientific name: Fulica americana</p>  <p>A common and widespread rail species, the American Coot is sometimes territorial but often gregarious outside of the breeding season, and may gather in noisy flocks to forage for underwater plant materials. Although strong fliers, American Coots need paddling starts across the waterâ€™s surface to become airborne.</p>  <p>American Coots are often prey for hawks, owls, and Bald Eagles, and when threatened they may begin splashing or actually dive to avoid capture. Repeated capture attempts by an aerial predator may result in exhaustion of a coot and its eventual capture.</p>";s:14:"descriptionUrl";s:37:"/birds/American-Coot/description.html";s:8:"imageUrl";s:85:"http://www.birdzilla.com/components/com_birds/files/42/img1/2_american-coot-cover.jpg";s:13:"imageFileName";s:6:"42.jpg";s:9:"imagePath";s:70:"/Users/alexanderberdnikov/htdocs/alexa/skills/birdzilla/content/42.jpg";s:13:"imageHttpsUrl";s:43:"https://alexa.phpse.com.ua/birdzilla/42.jpg";s:8:"soundUrl";s:35:"/birds/american-coot/play-song.html";s:8:"audioUrl";s:76:"http://www.birdzilla.com/components/com_birds/files/42/mp3/American-Coot.mp3";s:21:"originalAudioFileName";s:15:"42.original.mp3";s:17:"originalAudioPath";s:79:"/Users/alexanderberdnikov/htdocs/alexa/skills/birdzilla/content/42.original.mp3";s:13:"audioFileName";s:6:"42.mp3";s:9:"audioPath";s:70:"/Users/alexanderberdnikov/htdocs/alexa/skills/birdzilla/content/42.mp3";s:13:"audioHttpsUrl";s:43:"https://alexa.phpse.com.ua/birdzilla/42.mp3";s:8:"fanFacts";s:0:"";}
